A lightweight web component to overlay snowfall on a webpage using HTML5 Canvas.

Usage:

Download and add the `dist/snow.js` file to your webpage, and add an `rgthree-snow` element.

```
<rgthree-snow></rgthree-snow>
<script src="/my/js/dir/snow.js"></script>
```

You can configure the number of `flakes` as well:

```
<rgthree-snow flakes="800"></rgthree-snow>
<script src="/my/js/dir/snow.js"></script>
```
